Rules:

Every user gets 5 free likes. After they spend it, they need to wait for 24h or buy a subscription for unlimited likes. This demo account has only one like. If you tap on somebody, a counter will appear. Then tap on another person to see purchasing modal. Please don't make an account that is breaking TOS, this is a production database.

How to test monetisation:

1. Use provided credentials to login with Facebook (first reviewer already went through onboarding)
2. Tap on a person to spend remaining like
3. When a counters appears, tap on another person to see Get Premium modal
